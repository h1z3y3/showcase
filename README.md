# M3O Showcase

Showcase your apps built with M3O

## Overview

We want to provide a place where users can showcase apps built with m3o. Logically it makes sense to 
make that a website called [builtwithm3o.com](https://builtwithm3o.com). The best apps will earn 
rewards. See [here](https://github.com/m3o/m3o/discussions/113) for more info.

## Getting Started

Build a web app using the M3O apis. Host is using the [M3O Apps](https://m3o.com/app) service for 
free or a similar hosting provider. See [helloworld](https://github.com/m3o/helloworld) for an 
example. 

Once you've built the app, submit it in a PR here including a screenshot and we'll feature 
it on the website. That's it!
